# ![libsodium](https://raw.github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/master/logo.png)

Sodium is an easy-to-use software library that provides a wide range of cryptographic operations including encryption, decryption, digital signatures, and secure password hashing.

It is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, and packageable fork of [NaCl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/). While maintaining API compatibility, libsodium extends functionality to improve usability and simplify the development of secure applications.
