PyNaCl is a Python binding to the `Networking and Cryptography library`_,
a crypto library with the stated goal of improving usability, security and
speed.

.. _Networking and Cryptography library: http://nacl.cr.yp.to/


Installation
------------

PyNaCl relies on libsodium_, a portable C library which can be compiled
on a variety of systems. It may already be available from your package
manager.

.. _libsodium: https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium

Once libsodium is installed, PyNaCl can be installed by:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py install


Features
--------

* Digital signatures
* Secret-key encryption
* Public-key encryption
* One-time authentication
* HMAC (coming soon)


Changes
-------

* 0.3.0: the low-level API (`nacl.c.*`) has been changed to match the
  upstream NaCl C/C++ conventions (as well as those of other NaCl bindings).
  The order of arguments and return values has changed significantly. If you
  have code which calls these functions (e.g. `nacl.c.crypto_box_keypair()`),
  you must review the new docstrings and update your code to match the new
  conventions.
